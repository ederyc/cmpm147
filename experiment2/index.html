				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</p>
				<p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/18308a35-3eb4-4f8a-bf8e-b597d7d56af2/aurora_borealis.jpg?v=1744693829904">

				<p>With this experiment I wanted to try and make a procedurally generated version of this image above of the Aurora Borealis.  This specific image was found by searching “cool scenery” on Google, leading me to the source of the image. </p>

			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p>
				<p>There were 4 main things which I wanted to portray that I thought would capture the main essence of the original image.  Those things were the water foreground, the mountains, the dark night blue sky, and the green borealis.  My plan on how to execute these remained mostly the same throughout the entire process, as I made sure not to overcomplicate things.</p>
				<p>I knew that I wanted to make the mountains using noise like the many examples shown in class, the sky could be divided into the blue and bright green easily, and I wanted to make the water a gradient somehow.  I was able to accomplish these main objectives, as well as some additional touches to make the images feel more alive as I initially thought my efforts to be somewhat bland.</p>
				<p>To spice things up a little, I made the water a sine wave that would move to make it somewhat closer to real water.  I also added stars (small little white dots) that move around the sky.  The effect of the stars also moving in front of the mountain range was unintended and I was initially going to “fix” it, but I honestly really dig it and think it adds to the mysticism of the design.</p>
				<p>The gradient in the water was made by drawing multiple layers of waves, which recursively got darker until going black.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
				<p>I had never really dealt with using noise in this fashion before, but thanks to the examples given in class I was able to come up with mountains that I'm pretty happy with.  The mountains, along with the figuring out how the stars would move were the most complicated and time-consuming parts of the project.</p>
				<p>However, once I was able to figure these out, I was better equiped to tackle the water, as it was a combination of both sine waves and movement.</p>
